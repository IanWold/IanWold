Hi, I'm Ian! I'm a software engineer, architect, and team leader based in Minneapolis with 14 years of professional experience. My bread and butter is .NET, but I find enjoyment and interest in using a diverse set of technologies.

I write on my blog at [ian.wold.guru](https://ian.wold.guru). You should check out [my most popular post](https://ian.wold.guru/Posts/just_use_postgresql.html), my series on [the fallacies of distributed computing](https://ian.wold.guru/Series/fallacies_distributed_computing.html), or maybe a [collection of how-to posts](https://ian.wold.guru/Topics/how-to.html).

You can follow me here on GitHub, subscribe to [my monthly book club](https://buttondown.com/ianwold), or connect with me [via plenty other avenues](https://ian.wold.guru/connect.html)!
